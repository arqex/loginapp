## Create database models

The API will allow you to create authenticated endpoints that are usually used to access data from database tables.

Creating the database models is done using the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM. You can check the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) to know more about it.
